## Changelog

### Dependencies

- Comes embedded (jar-in-jar) with [Ranged Weapon API](https://github.com/FabricExtras/RangedWeaponAPI) `1.1.0+1.20.1-fabric`.

### Gameplay

+ Added support for [Ranged Weapon API](https://github.com/FabricExtras/RangedWeaponAPI). This is considered a **breaking change**, and removes the original Projectile Damage Attribute.

+ Removed stdout logging of damage (possible console clutter).

+ Some translations are missing, if you are knowledgeable in a certain language, please send a PR or present your interest!

+ Oops, forgot to include the Ranged Weapon API... should be fixed now.
